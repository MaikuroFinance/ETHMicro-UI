# Treasury
The Treasury is a contract and only entity that has permissions to mint or burn ETHMicro and ETHKey as well as receive and send collateral. It serves as the entrance and exit to the ecosystem

## Key Features
- Contains the minting and redemption features
- Handles all ETH collateral
- Completely Decentralized - no one can access the underlying collateral outside the redemption process as the contract is locked on initialization

For those looking for more technical specifics of the implementation please refer to the smart contract code here:
