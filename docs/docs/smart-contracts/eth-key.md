# ETH Key
ETH Key is an ERC20 token that earns yield through the collection of the deposit fees and 40% of transfer fees which are distributed among all ETHKey holders at that point in time.
## Key Features
- Gains yield in a wallet leaving you more accessibility to your crypto in times of market volatility
- Rewards are only accessible through the redemption process
- Rewards are forfeit to the current holders of ETHKey upon transfer to another contract or wallet 
- Completely Decentralized - no one can access the underlying collateral outside the redemption process as the contract is locked on initialization
- Excess supply of 100 million has been minted to ensure adequate liquidity for redemptions
