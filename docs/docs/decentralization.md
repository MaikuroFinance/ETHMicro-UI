# Fully Decentralized

Unlike other projects that are centralized because their code is controlled by singular entities such as corporations, this project is fully decentralized.

The project has no owner with any administrative permissions and the keys used to deploy the contract have been burned. This means that there is no entity that can rug-pull the contracts or access the underlying collateral.

## Locked Contracts

Contracts are deployed, configured and locked once they are configured so more changes can be made over the life of the contract.

## Available Forever

This is a permanent feature on the Ethereum blockchain, controlled by no one, built to provide you a fully-decentralized yield opportunity for the lifetime of the Ethereum network.
